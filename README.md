### Introduction
The goal of the project is to create an iOS app for children with motor problems<br>
that will allow them to paint a coloring book with the front camera of their device<br>
using gaze focusing technology - a system that allows using head control and gaze recognition (An evolving approach in the field of intelligence the artificial).<br>
The app is intended for children with motor problems who cannot operate a computer or any assistive technology that works with buttons<br>
And our app will help them expand their capabilities.

### Work Process
We integrated a drawing app with a library called HeadGazeLib,<br>
which allows gaze focused with the device's camera and track the movement of the head,<br>
that enabling coloring of a drawing booklet.
